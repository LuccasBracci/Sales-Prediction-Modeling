# Sales Predictions

## Creating a model for sales predictions 

### Problem: 
  
  How can we use machine learning models to acccurately forecast outlet sales based on 8 different variables?

### Data dictionary:

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Variable Name</strong></td>
            <td><strong>Description</strong></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Item_Identifier</td>
            <td>Unique product ID</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Item_Weight</td>
            <td>Weight of product</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Item_Fat_Content</td>
            <td>Whether the product is low fat or regular</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Item_Visibility</td>
            <td>The percentage of total display area of all products in a store allocated to the particular product</td></tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Item_Type</td>
            <td>The category to which the product belongs</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Item_MRP</td>
            <td>Maximum Retail Price (list price) of the product</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Outlet_Identifier</td>
            <td>Unique store ID</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Outlet_Establishment_Year</td>
            <td>The year in which store was established</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Outlet_Size</td>
            <td>The size of the store in terms of ground area covered</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Outlet_Location_Type</td>
            <td>The type of area in which the store is located</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Outlet_Type</td>
            <td>Whether the outlet is a grocery store or some sort of supermarket</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Item_Outlet_Sales</td>
            <td>Sales of the product in the particular store. This is the target variable to be predicted.        
</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
            </table>
